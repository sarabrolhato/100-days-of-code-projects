# The coffee machine project
# The goal of this project is to build the program for a coffee vending machine.

# Program requirements:
# 1. The user chooses what drink they would like, or if they would like to see the report for the machine's resources.
# 2. The user can also choose to turn off the machine.
# 3. Based on the ordered drink, the machine checks if the available resources are available, and asks for payment.
# 4. The machine collects the payment.
# 5. The machine checks if the transaction was successful (total amount paid was enough to buy the chosen drink), and gives the change, if applicable.
# 6. Makes the coffee.
# 7. Updates the resources available (ingredients and money).
# 8. The machine asks for the order of the next customer until the machine is turned off.
